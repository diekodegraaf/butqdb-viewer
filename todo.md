## TODO List

1. Fix the classes in legend. The numbering of the classes is incorrect due to the inclusion of class 0. where did I filter class 0??? also unique in legend
2. Change the functionality of the next class buttons to just shift over the segments and not completly skip to the start of the next segment. Also create the funcitonality to go back following the same ciriteria for class segments.
3. Change the layout of the buttons to fix the sticky position. Also use colours for the class indication.
4. Change the plots for the overviews to position them better and also make them faster to load? png? or what are the options?
5. Allow for overview to indepth signal view navigation? fill in timestamp? better options?
